Course Overview
---------------

This course examines democratic performance in the United States. We begin by examining the theoretical foundations of democratic representation. Then, we spend two weeks on public opinion. We will examine the origins of public opinion, as well as various approaches for measuring public opinion. Next, we examine factors, such as malapportionment, that lead to non-majoritarian outcomes. Next, we review the empirical evidence about how well policy outcomes reflect public opinion, and whether certain groups are over or under-represented in the policy process. Finally, we discuss institutional reforms that might make our democracy more responsive to the American public.

Academic Integrity
------------------

Students are encouraged to talk to one another outside of class about issues discussed in class and to brainstorm about essays. You often learn best from your peers. However, each student is expected to write his or her own essays and exam notes individually.
